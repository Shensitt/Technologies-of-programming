Android is designed to run on many different types of devices, from phones to tablets and televisions.
As a developer, the range of devices provides a huge potential audience for your app.
In order for your app to be successful on all these devices, it should tolerate some feature variability and provide a
flexible user interface that adapts to different screen configurations.
To facilitate your effort toward that goal, Android provides a dynamic app framework in which you can provide
configuration-specific app resources in static files (such as different XML layouts for different screen sizes).
Android then loads the appropriate resources based on the current device configuration.
So with some forethought to your app design and some additional app resources, you can publish a single application package
(APK) that provides an optimized user experience on a variety of devices.
If necessary, however, you can specify your app's feature requirements and control which types of
devices can install your app from Google Play Store. This page explains how you can control which devices have
access to your apps, and how to prepare your apps to make sure they reach the right audience. For more information
about how you can make your app adapt to different devices, read Supporting Different Devices.
