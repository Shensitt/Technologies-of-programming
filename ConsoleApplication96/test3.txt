1  A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output.
2  Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
3  Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
4  There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.
5  Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms,
6  music boxes and player pianos.
7  The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior
8  in response to different inputs or conditions.
9  Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year.
10  Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform)
11  while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
12  The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form)
13  and semantics (meaning).
14  Some languages are defined by a specification document
15  (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while
16  other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.
17  Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from
18  the dominant implementation being common.
19  Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design,
20  implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

1  Android is designed to run on many different types of devices, from phones to tablets and televisions.
2  As a developer, the range of devices provides a huge potential audience for your app.
3  In order for your app to be successful on all these devices, it should tolerate some feature variability and provide a
4  flexible user interface that adapts to different screen configurations.
5  To facilitate your effort toward that goal, Android provides a dynamic app framework in which you can provide
6  configuration-specific app resources in static files (such as different XML layouts for different screen sizes).
7  Android then loads the appropriate resources based on the current device configuration.
8  So with some forethought to your app design and some additional app resources, you can publish a single application package
9  (APK) that provides an optimized user experience on a variety of devices.
10  If necessary, however, you can specify your app's feature requirements and control which types of
11  devices can install your app from Google Play Store. This page explains how you can control which devices have
12  access to your apps, and how to prepare your apps to make sure they reach the right audience. For more information
13  about how you can make your app adapt to different devices, read Supporting Different Devices.
