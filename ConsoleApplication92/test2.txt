A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output.
Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year.
Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform)
The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form)
(for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while
implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.
