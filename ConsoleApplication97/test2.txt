Android is designed to run on many different types of devices, from phones to tablets and televisions.
As a developer, the range of devices provides a huge potential audience for your app.
In order for your app to be successful on all these devices, it should tolerate some feature variability and provide a
flexible user interface that adapts to different screen configurations.
